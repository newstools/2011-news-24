Relief packages will be distributed to about 8 500 families whose homes were damaged by flooding in Mamelodi, Pretoria, aid organisation Gift of the Givers said today.   “We had promised that though our initial response was in KZN, which at that time was the worst affected, our teams were on standby for other provinces. That promise comes to pass today.”
