THE Bang Bang Club was an informal name given to four photographers who captured the violence in the townships in the early 90â€™s. One (Ken Oosterbroek) was killed, another (Kevin Carter) committed suicide. The other two, Greg Marinovitch and Joao Silva, wrote a book called The Bang Bang Club. Marinovich won the Pulitzer for Spot News Photography in 1991 for his coverage of the killing of Lindsaye Tshabalala in 1990. Carter won the Pulitzer for Featured Photography in 1994 for his 1993 photograph of a vulture that appeared to be stalking a starving child in Sudan.
