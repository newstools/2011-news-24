Julian RademeyerSOUTH African Secret Service head Moe Shaik said yesterday that the murder of his friend, crime boss Cyril Beeka, has come as a &ldquo;heck of a shock&rdquo;.He denied reports that Beeka had been his bodyguard at the ANC&rsquo;s Polokwane conference in 2007, and said that as a &ldquo;matter of policy&rdquo; he could not confirm or deny suggestions that Beeka had worked for the National Intelligence Agency or SASS.Beeka was gunned down by a motorcycle-mounted &ldquo;hit team&rdquo; in Bellville in Cape Town on Monday.Shaik said &ldquo;the manner in which he was killed was terrible. I&rsquo;m not used to motorbike hits and that kind of thing.&rdquo;Shaik, whose relationship with Beeka has been a source of controversy, said he was unaware that Beeka had any links to the criminal underworld.&ldquo;I have heard these rumours, but I didn&rsquo;t get involved in his businesses. My relationship with him was different. I liked his jovial nature.&ldquo;I did ask him about [the allegations of criminal links] and he often denied it to me and that was it &hellip;&ldquo;He never asked me to do anything to clear his name; he never asked me for any special favours.&rdquo;Shaik also denied reports that Beeka &mdash; who accompanied him to the ANC&rsquo;s landmark Polokwane conference in 2007 &mdash; had been his bodyguard.&ldquo;The truth of the matter is that Cyril Beeka gave me a lift to Polokwane. He was my friend and my association with him was absolutely on friendly terms and I know nothing of his business and he knows nothing of what I do.&rdquo;He said there had been attempts &ldquo;to discredit me by associating me with this underworld boss thing&rdquo;, Shaik said, adding that he found it &ldquo;irritating and deeply offensive&rdquo;.Indications are that Beeka may have fallen in a bitter turf war that has rocked Cape Town&rsquo;s ganglands in recent weeks.As speculation mounted yesterday about the motive for Beeka&rsquo;s killing, a well-placed source told Media24 Investigations that Beeka and his Serbian driver and bodyguard, Sasha Kovasevic, were attacked at about 5 pm, not long after they left the home of a senior Sexy Boys gang boss.A gunman on the back of a motorcycle fired &ldquo;concentrated&rdquo; bursts of gunfire at the BMW X5 in which Beeka and Kovasevic were travelling.Beeka died at the scene. Kovasevic is in hospital.Beeka is also understood to have held a meeting two weeks ago at a restaurant in Monte Vista in Cape Town with a leader of the notorious Americans gang to discuss apparent efforts by the Americans to encroach on &ldquo;territory&rdquo; in the Cape Town CBD that Beeka regarded as his.A source with extensive knowledge of Beeka&rsquo;s business activities told Media24 Investigations yesterday that he believed Beeka was the victim of a &ldquo;fight for turf&rdquo;.Beeka, who had interests in security companies and ran teams of bouncers, was apparently trying to entrench his &ldquo;control&rdquo; over clubs and protection rackets in the Cape Town CBD.But, said the source, the &ldquo;Americans are trying to infiltrate every area where there is live entertainment and push drugs&rdquo;.Police would yesterday not publicly speculate on the possible motive for Beeka&rsquo;s killing.He was closely linked to Czech fugitive and alleged &ldquo;mob boss&rdquo; Radovan Krejcir and is named in the police&rsquo;s ongoing investigation into Krejcir.In an affidavit, Krejcir&rsquo;s former personal physician, Dr Marian Tupy, states that Beeka and George Louka aka George Smith, the man alleged to have killed Teazer&rsquo;s boss Lolly Jackson, were illicitly dealing gold and diamonds.Another affidavit, by businessman and gold refiner Juan Meyer, accuses Beeka of conspiring with Krejcir and members of the police&rsquo;s crime intelligence unit to have Meyer arrested on false criminal charges in a bid to intimidate him.The police are said to be closing in on Krejcir, who was implicated in a R4,5&thinsp;million insurance fraud last week after Tupy entered into a plea bargain deal with prosecutors to receive a suspended sentence in exchange for his testimony.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
