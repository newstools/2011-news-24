A MAN was stabbed to death and his younger brother also sustained a serious knife injury when they were attacked by their “drunk best friend” in a Pietermaritzburg rural village on Friday night. It is alleged that before Dumsani Memela was killed he intervened and took the side of his “alleged” killer, who was involved in a heated argument with another man. “The argument died down, and they all continued drinking. Later Dumsani went out of the house they were in. Then his friend followed and stabbed him in the chest. People heard him screaming “he stabbed me,” said Memela’s uncle Zamokwakhe Memela. The attack happened at about 7pm. He said the deceased’s younger brother Bafana was also allegedly stabbed by the same knife-wielding man when he tried to apprehend him. He was taken to Edendale Hospital. The attacker was allegedly badly beaten by local residents before he was handed over to the police. “Now he is denying knowing about the incident. Those who went to visit him in holding cells said that he claims to remember nothing about the incident. “The attacker is the best friend of this family. He drinks, eats and even sleeps here. His (the attacker’s) mother is so depressed by the incident. She said she wished her son had also died,” alleged the uncle. A police spokesperson said the accused will  appear in the Pietermaritzburg Court soon.
