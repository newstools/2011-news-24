THE KwaZulu-Natal Legislature yesterday passed the 2011/2012 KwaZulu-Natal Appropriation Bill that approves all 16 budget votes for different provincial governments, which were recently presented before the legislature. The bill was passed despite opposition from the Inkatha Freedom Party  and the Democratic Alliance  who objected to certain programmes within the votes. The DA objected to two votes — for  social development and public works — on the grounds that these departments should not be stand-alone departments, but should fall under existing departments in the provincial government. “We believe the social development should be under the Department of Health and the all departments should have Public Works sections under them,” DA caucus leader John Steenhuisen said. The IFP supported all 16 votes but objected to some programmes within them which prompted speaker Neliswa Peggy Nkonyeni to put all programmes to the vote. They eventually received the assenting votes of the majority of the members. The IFP, which is the official opposition in the legislature, objected to five programmes: programme 3 on policy and governance of vote 1 (premier), programme 1 on administration of vote 2 (provincial legislature), programme 2 on integrated economic development services of vote 4 (economic development and tourism), programme 8 on housing development of vote 8 (human settlements) and programme 1 on administration of vote 13 (social development). When put to vote, the programmes were passed without any hindrance — despite an absence of 14 members during yesterday’s sitting. This means that KZN government can now start working on delivering on the promises made by the ruling party.
